title: Rate Limits
description: Understand API rate limits by plan
---

## Overview

Rate limits are enforced per workspace and vary based on your subscription plan. Rate limits are applied on a per-hour basis.

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information in the headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed per hour
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current hour
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the rate limit window resets

## Rate Limits by Plan

| Plan    | Requests per Hour |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Free    | No API access     |
| Starter | 1,000             |
| Growth  | 10,000            |
| Pro     | 100,000           |

## Rate Limit Exceeded

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "limit": 1000,
  "reset_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

The response will also include the rate limit headers showing when the limit will reset.

## Best Practices

- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to track your usage
- Implement exponential backoff when you receive a 429 response
- Consider upgrading your plan if you consistently hit rate limits
- Cache responses when possible to reduce API calls
