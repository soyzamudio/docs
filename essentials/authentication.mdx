## Overview

All API requests must be authenticated using a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

## Authentication Header

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer pk_live_YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example

Here's an example of an authenticated request:

```bash
curl https://www.referralloop.dev/api/v1/waitlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_live_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## API Key Format

API keys follow this format:

- **Live keys**: `pk_live_...`
- **Test keys**: `pk_test_...` (if available)

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Never expose your API keys:** - Don't commit them to version control - Don't
  include them in client-side code - Don't share them publicly - Rotate them if
  compromised
</Warning>

## Invalid API Key

If you use an invalid API key, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## Missing Authorization Header

If you don't include the Authorization header, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing or invalid authorization header"
}
```
