## Overview

The ReferralLoop API allows you to integrate waitlist and referral functionality into your application. This guide will help you make your first API request.

## Prerequisites

- A ReferralLoop account
- A paid subscription (API access is not available on the free plan)

## Step 1: Generate an API Key

1. Log in to your [ReferralLoop dashboard](https://www.referralloop.dev/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Copy the API key immediately - you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never commit them to version control or expose them
  in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Make Your First Request

Once you have your API key, you can start making requests to the API. Here's an example using cURL:

```bash
curl https://www.referralloop.dev/api/v1/waitlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_live_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Info>Replace `pk_live_YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.</Info>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://www.referralloop.dev/api/v1
```
